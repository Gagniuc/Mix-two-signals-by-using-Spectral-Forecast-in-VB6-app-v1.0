# Spectral Forecast equation VB6 app 1.0

Spectral Forecast equation VB6 app 1.0 - is a demo application designed in Visual Basic 6.0. This application can combine two signals in arbitrary proportions. Different cases can be seen, with two different waveform signals that are combined depending on the value of a so-called distance <i>d</i>. This distance <i>d</i> is defined from zero to the maximum value found above the two vectors that represent these signals. <i>Spectral Forecast equation VB6 app 1.0</i> has an issue with the autoredraw setting in the case of Form1. Thus, certain real-time processing delays can be observed. However, the version 2.0 that can be found [here](https://github.com/Gagniuc/Mix-two-signals-by-using-Spectral-Forecast-in-VB6-app-v2.0) does not pose a problem with autoredraw.
